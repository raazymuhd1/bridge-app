        question: "What types of assets does Connect support?", 
        answer: 'Initially, Connect will only support bridging wrapped assets. This means that any native token bridged through Connect and the underlying Wormhole Token Bridge will be received as a Wormhole-wrapped token on the destination chain. In some cases, Wormhole minted tokens are the canonical representation on the chain (e.g. WETH on Solana is a Wormhole minted token, seehttps://github.com/wormhole-foundation/wormhole-token-list) and in other cases Wormhole minted tokens can be swapped on the destination chainâ€™s DEX(s) for whatever assets you need (e.g. USDCeth bridged from Ethereum to Avalanche can be swapped for native USDC on Trader Joe).',

        question: "Will Connect support native asset bridging?", 
        answer: 'Yes, Connect will soon surface multiple Wormhole-powered services (e.g. cross chain asset swaps) that enable other forms of bridging more suitable for certain use cases. Check https://wormhole.com/connect for updates on Connect support.',
